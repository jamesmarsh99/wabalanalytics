,,2,,17,,,Frame inspiration: Mario Botta‚Äôs Seconda Armchair‚Ä®Weave inspiration: Michael van Beuren‚Äôs High Back Lounge Chair for Domus  This chair was featured in @mixtape.project  a monthly newsletter curated by my friends Liv and Summer. Their work is always thoughtful and beautifully put together‚Äîdefinitely worth checking out! My entry appears in their February issue  themed Tapestry. Read it below!!!   One of the things I love most about getting older is recognizing how wisdom unfolds‚Äîlike a tapestry‚Äîwhere every lesson learned weaves into the next  and each new experience enriches what you already know.  Nearly two years ago  I stumbled upon a Craigslist listing for two M√∏ller Model 71 chairs for $100 (a steal considering they retail for $1500 each). Both seats needed reweaving  and one had no seat at all. The seller was moving and said  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those projects I‚Äôve been meaning to do.‚Äù And just like that  they became one of those projects for me.  More than a year later‚Äîafter a mispurchase and a missed return window‚ÄîI finally got the right Danish cord and re-wove the chairs. For a brief moment  my bedroom was free of unfinished chairs.  Until this project.  Chair 01 is made up of two elements: a frame I welded and a seat I wove. The frame sat in my bedroom for nine months while I debated seat options. Finally  under the thumb of grad school application deadlines  I decided to make do with what I had. Armed with two pounds of not-Danish-cord-but-actually-paper-rush  I began weaving. I wanted a pattern that would emphasize the frame‚Äôs angularity and cantilever. The process was intricate  and by 3 AM  I had a chair‚Äîand two very swollen hands.  Chair 01 is a culmination of years of collected skills  trial and error  and the realization that design is an ongoing process of learning  experimenting  and refining.,2025-02-17 13:17:41
,,3,,15,,,Like a black turtleneck  designing a chair is an architectural rite of passage. This is my first chair  so naturally  as the minimalist architect I am  it‚Äôs called Chair 01. You can buy it! Maybe even a whole set? Anything is possible!! DM me! I welded the frame of this chair in a welding class with @michaeldanielmetal and I wove the seat by hand using paper rush.

,,1,,20,,,Hi I‚Äôm Taylor! When you‚Äôre an unlicensed architect  you call yourself an architectural designer‚Äîand that‚Äôs what I am. Working professionally as a designer  I design  but I don‚Äôt make. And for someone who loves making things  that‚Äôs a problem.¬†  The idea for Wabili Workshop started in December 2023. My mom had some leftover lamp kits from Christmas houses  and I decided to bring them back to New York. I loved the idea of making a lamp because it‚Äôs not something most people would think to try on their own‚Äîbut I wanted to show them that they could.  Hosting is one of my favorite things to do  so I gathered a group of friends and held a lamp-making class in my apartment. It was inspiring to see how uniquely each person approached the open-ended nature of the workshop. Hearing everyone‚Äôs excitement about what they created was so rewarding  and that‚Äôs when I knew I wanted to do more.   Since then  I‚Äôve been squeezing in workshops on weekends and after work  growing Wabili Workshop through word of mouth. I never got around to starting an Instagram  but applying to grad school forced me to take pictures of everything‚Äîso now I have no excuses. And here I am!  I‚Äôm excited you‚Äôre here and that you read this far!! People tell me this is long for Instagram lol,2025-01-20 05:12:42
